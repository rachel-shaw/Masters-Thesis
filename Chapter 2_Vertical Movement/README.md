# Chapter 2: Vertical Movement

This second chapter of my thesis focused on the diving behavior of young white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean.

The objective of this study was to determine how the YOY and juvenile white sharks are using the vertical habitat in the New York Bight nursery. The null hypotheses tested were as follows:
  1. Young white sharks will spend equal amounts of time across available water column temperatures.
  2. Young and juvenile white sharks will use the available water column depth evenly.
  3. Young and juvenile white sharks will show consistency in residual depth, or the distance between the shark and the sea floor.
  4. The dive depth of young white sharks is not affected by sea surface temperatures, time of day, water column temperatures, or cycle length.

The analyses that were conducted in R include the following:
  1. **Descriptive statistics** were analyzed to determine the depth and temperature the twelve tagged individuals swam in.
  2. **Dive profiles** were plotted against available bathymetry to determine the distance from the sea floor bottom while swimming.

Additional analyses on diving behavior were completed using SigmaPlot and Igor Pro software.
